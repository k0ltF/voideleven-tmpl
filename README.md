# k0ltF's Voideleven templates

Here are my dotfiles, as templates. The purpose of this repository is mostly
to share my config and also to have a last backup in case of emergency.

Everything here works or intends to works with the [BÉPO](https://bepo.fr)
keyboard layout. A french ergonomic (Dvorak way) keyboard layout.

The rice is not finished, and some stuff could probably work in a better way
… but I'm still learning.
