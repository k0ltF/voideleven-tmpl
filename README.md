# koltrast's Voideleven dotfiles

Here you can find my dotfiles. These are personal but you can probably find things that may interest you. Everything here works or intends to works with the [BÉPO](https://bepo.fr) keyboard layout. A french ergonomic (Dvorak way) keyboard layout.

The rice is not finished, and some stuff could probably work in a better way
